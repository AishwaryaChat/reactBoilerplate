React

1. Presentational components do not maintain state, and render something on the browser.
2. Container components do maintain state and render children.
3. STate can be changed and props can not.
4. COntainer component should only render its children and no other rendering.
5. The react app can have only one div root element.
6. Spread operator doesnt works in react, for that to work we have to install babel plugin stage-0, also add 'stage-0' in presets section of webpack.config.js
